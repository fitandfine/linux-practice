I recommend going through https://linuxjourney.com/

Tech jobs are harder to land than ever for beginners, but you've gotta start somewhere.
It's never too late to learn. Don't try to learn everything in a day. 
Better days are always ahead, keep pushing.

Excuse me for poor formatting, I am using nano text editor of ubuntu. I want to stick

PLEASE DON'T RUIN YOUR LEARNING REWARDS BY BYPASSING CHALLENGES.
THIS EXISTS JUST IN CASE YOU HAPPEN TO NOT CREATE BACKUPS OF PREVIOUS LEVELS!
